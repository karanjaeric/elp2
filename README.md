### Introduction </br>
The ELP techhub web portal is a project meant for management of Equity leaders program scholars in tech and tech related fields. This is my contribution in the development of the portal.</br>
It makes it easier for members to sign up for meetups, join project teams, get internal job advertisements and news all in real  time.</br>The management of the team is also able to generate daily reports in form of pdf and online versions. All these features come in a creatively designed dashboard which is accessible after login.</br>

The project is currently undergoing testing and is hosted on heroku. check it out in this link.

for admin account  use these details.</br>
**email**: admintesting@gmail.com</br>
**password**: testing@123Testing</br>
for a normal user use the following details.</br>
